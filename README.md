# **Where To Start**

## Components

If you need to make a new component, create a new directory with the name of the component in the `./client/src/components` directory. Then make a file with the name(s) of your component(s) in the newly created directory.

For implementation, it is almost as simple as plug and play for your code. Just insert the call for the component where it needs to go in either the pages, or another component you wish to put it in.

## Pages

Anything you need to add or change, can safely be done so with the pages components.

## App.js

For the most part, this component needs minimal editing unless you are working on styling or routing.

## Backend

For now, any files that are entirely commented out, or has `boiler` in it's name can be changed. These files have good references on working code for what they were originally meant for. We can change these files, or rewrite them completely as long as we keep the reference points for as long as we need.
