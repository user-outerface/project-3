## NPM

For installing the proper packages, go to the root for the project and type:

`yarn install`

Running this, yarn will install all the dependencies in the needed directories using instruction from the root `package.json`.

Always use `yarn add`. Don't use `npm intall` or `npm i`. This will mess with the yarn.lock otherwise, and will make life a lot more interesting than it needs to be.

Make sure you're in the proper directory for the installation of the needed packages. If it needs to be in the back end, make sure you are in the root directory. Otherwise if it's a front-end package, make sure you are in the `/client` directory before doing `yarn add`.
